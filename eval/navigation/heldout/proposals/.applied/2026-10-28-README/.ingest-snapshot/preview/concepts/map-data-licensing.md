# Map-data licensing is a downstream obligation

## Summary

Consumers of MAP-ATLAS must honor the licenses of the third-party map data the engine renders. The engine bundles no tiles. It takes no position on which data sources a consumer uses.

## Key ideas

- OpenStreetMap data is licensed under ODbL.
- OpenSeaMap seamarks are licensed under ODbL, which is share-alike.
- Bathymetry and elevation sources are licensed per product, not per publisher.
- Terms can differ between datasets from the same agency.
- Some datasets carry third-party contributions whose terms travel with them.
- A consumer must check the specific product and its contributor metadata. A publisher's general reputation is not enough.

## Where this shows up

- `README.md` section "Attribution & data licensing (downstream obligation)".
- `specs/architecture.md` section "Map data & licensing".
- ADR-0024 in `specs/decisions.md`.
